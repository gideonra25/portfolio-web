# Gideon Ramot's Portfolio

This repo contains the latest code for https://gideonrap.vercel.app. It's a Nuxt 3 project that centers around a WebGL visualization that ebs and flows into each page.

I've made the code open-source, with the obvious caveat that it's meant to act as a reference for learning and developing your own creative website, and that you cannot clone it and pretend to be me.
